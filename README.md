# StreamTool

These are a set of BAT files set up to help with converting game audio from one format to another using [vgmstream](https://www.vgmstream.org), [vgaudio](https://github.com/Thealexbarney/VGAudio) and [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org).

[Download the git repo](https://github.com/ActualMandM/StreamTool/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and click on `#SETUP.bat` to get started.

If you want to update most of the tools, run ~UPDATE.bat

Thanks PTKickass for helping with the downloading portion of SETUP and UPDATE.

To use a bat file, drag and drop a file supported by vgmstream onto one.
